## Decision Drivers
- Need simple way to brainstorm, generate persona, design C4, and Roadmap planning.

## Considered Options
- sigma
- miro

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Miro. Miro has easier interface for team members to collaborate. It is a better choice for simple design and brainstorm. It can served as whiteboard, which everyone can brainstorm on it using posters for each ideas. Figma, in comparison, is more complicated and better for formal UI design.
