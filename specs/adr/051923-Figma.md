# Use Figma for UI Design/Interface Design

- Status: Accepted
- Deciders: Annie Phan, Niklas Chang
- Date: 05/19/23

## Decision Drivers
- Need a way to flesh out our ideas more into formal diagrams
- Want to have an efficient way to translate design to code

## Considered Options
- Miro
- Figma

## Chosen Option:
Figma because it is good for having images/svgs that can be imported from UI Design to code. Also, most of the people on the team are more familiar with Figma.
