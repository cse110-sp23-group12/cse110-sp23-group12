## Decision Drivers
- Need a more cohesive website design and theme
- Want a more unique style of tarot card presentation

## Considered Options
- Midjourney
- Canva
- Online searching

## Chosen Option:
We chose Midjourney because it has the most customization and verstility for creating images. Trying to get online images will not be cohesive, and canva seemed to limited in its ability to customize with parameters and base images.
