# Mini Meeting Notes
## Attendees
- Max
- Brandon
- JD

## Time and Place
1-1:30pm over Zoom

## Agenda
Very informal, a short meeting to discuss our options for how to proceed with obscuring and protecting our API key in our codebase online as opposed to the way we were doing it locally

## Key Takeaways
- The plan that we came up with is to use another site (something like netlify) with restricted access to hide the API key in that our code can reference
- The plan is to try to implement this by or on Monday, with Max, Brandon, and Yuhang working on it
