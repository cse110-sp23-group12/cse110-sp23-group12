- Annie
- JD
## Where
5:30-6:15pm over Zoom

## Why
To discuss the project pitch

## What was Discussed
- Gagan has taken a look at the project pitch slides
- there is a risk with using AI to generate our images and text
  - we have to think about how the images and text could potentially be related to each other
  - this is an implementation detail that we need to figure out
- there needs to be a UI created for the project pitch and send it in to Gagan ASAP
- to approach the project, start designing the project from a high-level description (fat marker sketch) and then refine smaller details
  - our team needs to refine the specifications of our program
  - we need to come up with what it does: features, animations, sounds, etc.
  - voice synthesis might be an interesting feature to add in
- there can be multiple teams: UI/UX, documentation/testing/UI, backend, frontend.
- we can come up with the CI/CD pipeline in parallel with the coding
- our grade is mainly based on the process of our software engineering and code quality, rather than how many cool features our project has
