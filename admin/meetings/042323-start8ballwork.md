### For Next Time

     * Fix any bugs, add comments (using GPT to describe functionality?)
     * Make sure we like the look and feel of the UI
     * Make tests for our features and functionality
     * sound effects?
     * Combine branches w/o conflicts
    3. Finalize Slides
     * Everyone should take a look, add anything you have learned from using AI where you feel necessary
