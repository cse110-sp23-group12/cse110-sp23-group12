## Main Takeaways
### Accomplished
    1. Mark did some work with experimenting with ChatGPT prior for making a Fortune Teller Website
    2. We created a repo under /admin/8-ball and put Mark's Code in it
    3. We adapted and changed the code using ChatGPT to change the look of it and add features like music, back button, etc. 
    4. Started making testing and documentation
    5. Started work on slides for what we learned from using chatGPT
    6. We also have a second repo in our organization called 8ball that uses different functionality in generating responses
### For Next Time
    1. Finalize Website, testing, documentation
        - Fix any bugs, add comments (using GPT to describe functionality?)
        - Make sure we like the look and feel of the UI
        - Make tests for our features and functionality
        - sound effects?
        - Combine branches w/o conflicts
    3. Finalize Slides
        - Everyone should take a look, add anything you have learned from using AI where you feel necessary
    5. Make video!
    6. All done :)
