## Notes
- This is our last sprint given our time constraints. We had this retrospective to wrap things up. This is done for if we were to come back to this project in the future.

## Priorities Brought Up:
- GitHub Organization: felt that we needed better organization and that our code process is messy. We need to link issues to commits and had better testing.
  - Action Plan:
    - make sure that we link GitHub issues to our commits
    - have unit tests created before the code
    - make unit tests after creating the code
    - continuously testing code after making it

- UI/UX Design: team was happy in how the design looked, and we love the personalized tarot cards
  - Action Plan:
    - spend more time polishing out the user experience
    - add more personalized tarot cards
    - keep working hard

- Time Constraints: felt that we needed more time
  - Action Plan: 
    - more meetings in the future
    - daily check-ins
    - meet up with each other
    
- Progress: team enjoyed the progress that we all made together
  - Action Plan:
    - keep having assigned tasks and groups between peolpe
