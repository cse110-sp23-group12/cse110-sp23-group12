## Priorities Brought Up:
- Timeline: many feel that the progress is slow and there is not enough time to work on the code
  - Action Plan:
    - have more defined roles/tasks for each group member
    - split up the team into groups more often
    - have a task list for all the due dates/tasks that we need to do as a team
    - less talking in meetings, more doing
- Work Distribution: some feel that there is no direction/nothing to do, there is more talking than work, and coding is not spread around as much
  - Action Plan:
    - split up the group into smaller teams
    - a list of tasks to do for each group
    - check-ins on each other throughout the week to track progress
- Meeting Flow: there is potential confusion on what the group is doing, and not a deep understanding of a sprint meeting
  - Action Plan:
    - more assigned tasks
    - clear sprint meeting goals
    - make a timeline

- Diagramming/Design: team members generally enjoy the flowchart and diagrams that were created for our site
  - Action Plan:
    -  continue to develop the diagrams and make them more specific
    -  add more detail into the UI/UX design

## Main Takeaways:
- each team member needs to have better-defined roles
- we should split the team into groups more often
- need a clearer plan and assignment of tasks and goals
