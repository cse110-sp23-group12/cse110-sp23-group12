Plan: discuss what each person has done so far as a team

CI/CD pipeline:

- As a team, we have multiple YML files to separate the workflow, ESlint to enforce code style, and Jest Unit tests to test code
- Yuhang: shows demo of what the CI/CD pipeline team has been working on. He gets the linter, unit tests working, and separates the YML files
- Wing: research on how to set up the unit test and how the unit test can run
- Brandon: worked on writing out the ADRs for the tools that the team used, their pros and cons, and the generated JSDocs
- Jinpeng: working on reviewing the linter and improving the flow
- Max: research on why the linter was giving the pipeline problems and fixed it

Diagramming/Design team:
- Niklas, Mark, Joanna, Annie, JD mostly worked on this
- C4 diagrams, specifications created, user personas, UI/UX planning
- Niklas: currently working on a wireframe, C4 diagram for website, general idea of the UI page, feels we need to discuss as a group to decide the details to put in the webpage UI
- Ke Ma: figuring out the animation of the fortune cookies and interaction with the cards
- Joanna: created the UI/UX flowchart design in figma and plan to add more details to be more well-defined
