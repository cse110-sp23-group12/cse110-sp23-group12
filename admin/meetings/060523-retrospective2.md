## Priorities Brought Up:
- Working on Tasks: group members felt that not enough work was being done in between meetings and that we can spend more time outside of meetings doing work
  - Action Plan:
    - have assigned tasks that each person can do
    - divide members up into smaller groups and coordinate with each other on what tasks to do
    - use meetings as a time to assign tasks and plan out our next steps as a team
    - make a Timeline on what tasks each person should do

- GitHub Organization: we need to link our GitHub issues to our commits
  - Action Plan:
    - take a look at the GitHub issues that we have previously opened
    - whenver committing, please take a look to see what issue it corrsponds to

- Divided Tasks: group members enjoyed that tasks were done as small groups and tasks were divided up
  - Action Plan:
    - keep having assigned tasks and groups between peolpe
    - each person needs to play their own part and responsibilities

  - Action Plan:
    - keep being awesome
