Plan: discuss what each person has done so far in our second

## Testing:
- Wing: developed E2E testing across various pages in a browser. Add additional tests to whether or not a fortune cookie is added to a page. Additional unit tests created. 
- Jinpeng: developed E2E testing across various pages in a browser. Additional unit tests created. Trying to figure out why E2E test is failing in GitHub actions but not in local

## Backend Development:
- Yuhang: worked on getting responses from remote server, merged backend code between his and Max's version, worked on getting the API key, worked on the browser compatibility
- Max: reworked the backend development of how fortunes are generated. Changed local-first fotune generation, worked on getting API key and trying out options on what we can do
- Brandon: work on GitHub issues, commenting in the code quality for JSDocs to be generated, put together the team status video, screen recorded the development process

## Frontend and UI/UX: 
- Niklas: worked through the earlier to mid-stage design on figma, gathered the card images to show on the program, find sound effects for fortune cookie cracking audio files, wrote the ADRs for the Figma tool, and black/white high-level description wireframe. Trying to find a good background music for our app and generate more personalized images
- Joanna: did the UI pages in Figma, come up with fortune cookie animations, find new background image for our fortune cookie page
- Wing: did a few UI pages in Figma, add in landing page animation screen, re-size the items
